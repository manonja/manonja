## Hi there, I'm Manon! 👋

### 🌱 Currently Building:    
- AI products to help lawyers draft and search documents more efficiently [prae8](https://www.prae8.com/), 
- A OS Scheduler in **Rust** to deepen my understanding of first principles and deep core backend engineering.

### 🏔️ Recent Adventure: 
I am an avid explorator and adventurer, the last was a 40-day mountaineering expedition in the Indian Himalayas with NOLS. You can see some photos here.

### 🤝 Projects: 
- Led engineering & product development while integrating user feedback into product roadmaps for **[Nepal Climate Hub](https://nepalclimatehub.org/)** Tech Stack: Astro, Neon, React, CSS, and Netlify
- Created **Fundamental Backend Engineer**, a hands-on [curriculum](https://github.com/manonja/Backend-Engineering-Fundamentals) designed and currated with first principles and core backend fundamentals in mind. The curriculum is also a way to learn **Rust** and **Elixir** with real world projects, such as a **OS Scheduler Emulator**, a **port scanner**, or a **Real-time chat application**.
- Write the [Engineer's Climb](https://manonjacquin.substack.com/) newsletter where I share learnings about building AI product from a solo-builder perspective.
