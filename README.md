## Hi there, I'm Manon 

### Currently Building:    
- [QuickExpense](https://github.com/manonja/quickExpense): a receipt scanner using LLM to turn receipts into new expense and tax optimisation for solopreneurs. I am building it public, you can check the roadmap [here](https://www.notion.so/QuickExpense-Product-Roadmap-079fec152cf44a5aa7d0962387eb1740?source=copy_link). Stack: **fastAPI**, **gemini models**, **quickens API**, **iOS**, **Expo**
- A OS Scheduler in **Rust** to deepen my understanding of first principles and deep core backend engineering, as part of the curriculum I created.
- Privacy First AI product to help lawyers draft and chat over their own database more efficiently [prae8](https://www.prae8.com/). Stack: **Nextjs**, **Python**, **HuggingFace** Open Source models, **Supabase pg_vector Dabase** , **Runpod**, **GCP**, **Docker**, **Pulumi**

### Adventures: 
I am an avid explorator and adventurer, the last big one was a 40-day mountaineering expedition in the Indian Himalayas with NOLS. I write about some explorations [here](https://manon.substack.com/)

### Projects: 
- Led engineering & product development while integrating user feedback into product roadmaps for [Nepal Climate Hub](https://nepalclimatehub.org/) - Tech Stack: Astro, Neon, React, CSS, and Netlify
- Created **Fundamental Backend Engineer**, a hands-on [curriculum](https://github.com/manonja/Backend-Engineering-Fundamentals) designed and currated with first principles and core backend fundamentals in mind. The curriculum is also a way to learn **Rust** and **Elixir** with real world projects, such as a **OS Scheduler Emulator**, a **port scanner**, or a **Real-time chat application**.
- A [SaaS](https://github.com/manonja/mining-permits-agents) deploying multi agents to help mining companies assess the feasibility of their project in the light of the Environment Assessment Act in British Columbia, Canada. Stack: **CrewAI**, **Retool**, **QDrant**
- I love helping artists whenever I can, with a focus on design, speed AND high quality photo resolution. Thank you **cloudflare**! Example of a website [here](https://bossenbroek.photo/)
- Write the [Engineer's Climb](https://manonjacquin.substack.com/) newsletter where I share learnings about building AI product from a solo-builder perspective.
